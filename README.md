# Wolf-scanner

hello this tool developed for help begginer
that name is WOLF SCANNER ....!


This Python code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for running Nmap scans. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network.

Let's break down the code:

Imports: The code imports necessary modules such as tkinter, messagebox, and subprocess. tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, messagebox is used for displaying error messages, and subprocess is used to run shell commands.

run_nmap function: This function is designed to run Nmap commands. It takes a command as an argument and tries to execute it using subprocess.run(). If an error occurs during the process, it displays an error message using messagebox.showerror().

button_click function: This function is called when any button in the GUI is clicked. It retrieves the target IP address or name from the entry widget, constructs the appropriate Nmap command based on the selected scan type, and then executes the command. If there's an error during execution, it displays an error message. It also updates the result text widget with the output of the Nmap command.

Main GUI setup: The main GUI window is created using tk.Tk(), with the title "YASHWOLF V 1.0.1...!". Labels, entry widgets, buttons, and a text widget are added to the GUI using tk.Label(), tk.Entry(), tk.Button(), and tk.Text() respectively. These widgets are placed in specific rows and columns using the grid() method.

Button commands: Each button is associated with a specific scan type. When clicked, they call the button_click function with the corresponding scan type as an argument.

Result display: The output of the Nmap commands is displayed in a text widget (result_text). This widget is initially empty but gets updated with the output when a scan is performed.

Overall, this code provides a simple GUI interface for running various Nmap scans by selecting different scan types through buttons and entering the target IP address or name. It's a user-friendly way to interact with Nmap, especially for those who are not comfortable using the command line interface.

thanks
